  <p> Welcome to our final project for Data Visualization. In our project, we aimed to explore
  the various different crimes occuring in the city of San Francisco.</p>
  <h3><b><u>A brief overview</u></b></h3>
  <b><u>Map:</u></b><br> Here, you will find a map of San Francisco, drawn with the boundry line of
  the neighborhoods within the city. The darker the shade of purple, the more crime happened in that part
  of the city in 2016. We've also built in an option for the user to plot points of specific crimes on the map.<br><br>

  <b><u>Tree:</u></b><br>
  On this tab, you will find a more generalized view of the crime broken down by area of the city
  For aesthetic and interpretability, we have included a table and broad categories of crime.<br><br>

  <b><u>Time:</u></b><br>
  We suspected there to be quite a bit of movement in crimes throughout the year, and included a plot that shows
  the changes in crime by hour of the day, by month and by day of the week.<br><br>

  <b><u>Heat:</u></b><br>
  In this heatmap section, we wanted the user to be able to compare neighborhoods side by side. Areas of
  darker orange/red are areas with more concentrated crime.<br><br>
